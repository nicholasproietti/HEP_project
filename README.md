# HEP_project
HEP project is a program that was written for my SUNY Oswego undergraduate physics capstone project with fellow student Anthony Chalmers. The program was made to reconstruct Z boson, W boson, and top quark invariant mass spectra as an end goal, but also to perform other analytical tasks using the [ROOT framework](https://root.cern/) on [CMS open-source data from CERN](http://opendata.cern.ch/record/50).
