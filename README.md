# HEP_project
HEP_project is a program that was written for my undergraduate capstone project with fellow student Anthony Chalmers. The program was made to reconstruct Z boson, W boson, and top quark invariant mass spectra as an end goal, but also to perform other analytical tasks using ROOT framework on CMS open-source data from CERN.
